1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * Convoke the Spirits will cast:
        - 3 to 5 heals
        - Chance to cast Starfall if it's not up with a weight of 1.0
        - Chance to cast Moonfire if it's not up with a weight of 0.3
        - Chance to cast Starsurge with a weight of 0.3
        - Chance to cast Wrath with a weight of 0.4
        - 20% chance to replace a damage spell with Full Moon

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC makes the following assumptions:
        - You are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you
        - 15% of the pool is lost from taking damage
        - The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you

1. What is the base profile used in the sims?
    * The base character can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt).
    * All items are from Mythic Castle Nathria.
    * Full 6 mastery gems are socketted and all available enchants are applied.
    * Legendary items are set to ilevel 235 with Haste & Mastery.
    * All raid buffs and consumables are used.
    * 'Smart Sim' setting is used for each set of talents with a fixed covenant & legendary. This means that for each covenant & legendary combo, the talents that sim highest will be more accurate than the talents that sim the lowest.

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is a ***LARGELY UNOPTIMIZED APPROXIMATION*** of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

1. What is the 'Dungeon' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [dungeon.txt](dungeon.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~450s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * The following bugs are present in the game AND in SimC
        - Niya's Tools: Burrs will not do any damage to slow-immune mobs, such as bosses
    * The following bugs are present in the game but NOT in SimC
        - Adaptive Swarm will not jump onto an ally that already has a Swarm and will fizzle if there are no other friendly targets.
