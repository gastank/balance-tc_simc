    * Random targets encounter approximation is added as 'M+' in the target dropdown. See below for details.

1. What is the '*M+*' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an *unoptimized, very crude approximation* of a random dungeon-like encounter. The details can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * ~360s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight

1. What about conduits?
    * All sims include the covenant specific conduits (except for Kyrian) and the Fury of the Skies conduit at base rank.
    * The other potency conduits at current tuning contribute less than 1% and are not worth simming.
    * The Kyrian conduit can desync Kindred Spirits from other CDs so is not worth simming.

1. What about soulbinds?
    * Soulbinds are not yet fully implemented in SimC.

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * SimC assumes it will cast 2 healing spells, 1 Starfall if it isn't up, 1 Moonfire if you have a target without it, then balance out the remaining between Starsurge, Wrath, and Moonfire on any further un-dotted targets.

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC assumes that you are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you. The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you.
